# Product Requirements Document (PRD): User Management System (UMS)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Author**: Grok 3 (xAI)  
**Status**: Draft  

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This PRD defines the requirements for the User Management System (UMS), a web-based application designed to manage users with distinct roles, provide role-specific content, and support software testing. The system will be deployed on a production website, integrate with multiple authentication providers, and include a CI/CD pipeline for continuous development and testing.

### 1.2 Scope
The UMS will:
- Support six user roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer, Tester, Developer, Guest) with fully isolated content access.
- Use Firebase services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) for backend functionality.
- Integrate with email/password and OAuth/SSO providers (Google, Apple, X, Facebook, TikTok, Microsoft).
- Provide testing tools for UI, API, security, and database testing, with a sandbox environment.
- Deploy on Azure with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Playwright.
- Ensure OWASP compliance and support 100 concurrent users with responsive design using Bootstrap.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Enable secure, role-based access to content for different user types.
- Facilitate software testing with automated and manual tools in a sandbox environment.
- Provide a scalable, secure, and maintainable system for production use.
- Achieve deployment within 6 months (by December 11, 2025).

## 2. User Personas

| **Persona** | **Description** | **Goals** | **Pain Points** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Admin**   | System administrator managing users and content. | Manage users, modify content, monitor system health. | Complex user management, security risks. |
| **Editor**  | Content creator updating reports and dashboards. | Edit content efficiently, preview changes. | Limited editing tools, access restrictions. |
| **Viewer**  | End-user viewing public content. | Access reports and dashboards easily. | Slow load times, unclear navigation. |
| **Tester**  | QA engineer testing system functionality. | Run UI/API/security/database tests in a sandbox. | Lack of isolated testing environments. |
| **Developer** | API consumer exploring system APIs. | Access API documentation and test endpoints. | Poor API documentation, limited access. |
| **Guest**   | Anonymous user viewing public content. | View limited content without login. | Restricted access, poor UX for guests. |
